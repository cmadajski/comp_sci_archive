# Programming Languages Archive
This repo is filled with scripts that I use for learning, practicing, and referencing the different
technologies that I've been exposed to over the years. This also serves to show my experience
with the different technologies and is quite useful for when I forget how to do basic things
in languages that I haven't touched in a long while.

## Current Languages
- Python (started in 2021)
- Golang (started in 2022)
- C (started in 2018)
- React (started in 2022)
- Flask (started in 2021)
